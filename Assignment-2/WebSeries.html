                Superheroes are often as popular as celebrities,
                 as influential as politicians, and sometimes
                  even as revered as gods. But that's when
                   they're using their powers for good. What
                    happens when the heroes go rogue and start
                     abusing their powers? When it's the 
                     powerless against the super powerful,
                      the Boys head out on a heroic quest to
                       expose the truth about the Seven and 
                       Vought, the multibillion-dollar 
                       conglomerate that manages the superheroes
                        and covers up their dirty secrets.
                         Based on the comic book series of

                  can't get much worse. His salary
                   barely makes ends meet, a situation

                        dumbstruck when he learns he
                         has terminal cancer. Realizing
                          that his illness probably
                           will ruin his family financially
                           , Walter makes a desperate bid
                            to earn as much money as he can
